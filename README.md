# Simplified Real-Time Multiplayer Game

## Objective
* Build a basic real-time multiplayer tic-tac-toe game using Socket. IO. This will involve creating a game server and a client-side game interface.

## Requirements:

### Server-side:

* Set up a Node.js server using Express.
* Implement Socket.IO to handle real-time communication.
* Create a game state object to track the board and current player.
* Manage game logic, including determining the winner or a draw.
* Broadcast game updates to all connected clients.

### Client-side:

* Create a simple game board interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Implement Socket.IO client-side to connect to the server.
* Handle user input (e.g., clicking on a cell).
* Send more information to the server.
* Update the game board based on incoming game updates.
* Display the current player and game status (winner, draw).
